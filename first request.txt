│ > i want to create a data logging application for a coffee roaster. the aim of this is to collect a number of streams of data for    │
│   subsequent coffee roasts. the data might be temperature, humidity, CO2, VOC against time. initially we'll capture temp and         │
│   humidity and add the others later. there may be further data streams added in future. the data needs to be accessed from a web     │
│   interface, with the primary screen being a list of available roasts against timestamps. when a roast is selected the data is       │
│   displayed on a chart. Roasts are typically 10 minutes in length. Capture datapoints every second. One use for this data will be    │
│   to try and estimate/predict when the first crack occurs. you are a experienced coffee roaster and software engineer. write me a    │
│   product requirement document for this application. you can ask me up to 6 questions to clarify any points. The application should  │
│   be written in python and will run on a raspberry pi compute module with 16Gb disk. the available sensor are dht22, adafruit        │
│   sht31, adafruit sgp30. use context7.                                                                                               │
